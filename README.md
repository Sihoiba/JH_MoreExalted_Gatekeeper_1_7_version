# JH_MoreExalted_Gatekeeper_1_7_version
Jupiter hell mod separated out as Epyon implemented his version of the GATEKEEPER exalted trait in version 1.8

This mod replaces his version with the version I implemented against 1.7.

* GATEKEEPER - Turns into miniboss. Locks main and branch level exits until killed. Doesn't look special, mini or other exits. Max 1 per level.

## Installing
